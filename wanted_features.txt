in the bottom of side bar add a pookie pink gradient button with white text "Tempersons Globe", clicking it will open a page that asks for a name and info (only first time then it will save info), so their device will register as that name, so they can message there. So every person will be registered and they can chat in that area, this will be called "Tempersons Globe", so help me set a cloud or anything for the chat, and chat will sort as days in chat history. If we click the the sidebar, we get an option of history, and if we click, we can see chats sorted by dates, weeks, and months, and years, so we can chat with each other and tag by names, we can use emojis, and old chats will not be deleted but we can edit our messages in 30mins after sending, and all options that we can use in chat, so tell me whole process.
The chat will look like instagram but, but minimal and cute like Pookie mode.
